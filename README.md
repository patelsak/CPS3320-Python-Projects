Project #1 (https://github.com/patelsak/project-1): I created a Tic Tac Toe game for this project. This Python project was built using the library of Pygames. 

Project #2 (https://github.com/patelsak/project-2): In this project I used three different libraries in Python that I did some research on and after that I have a thorough understanding of them through the practice code files I have implemented.

Final Project (https://github.com/patelsak/Final-Project): For my final project I built an expense tracker. Expense tracker is a simple project developed using python which helps us to analyse our expenses by storing them in a systematic tabular form. I will use tkinter for GUI. Some of the project prerequisites are Basic concepts of Python and Tkinter.
